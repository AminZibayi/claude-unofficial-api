Write short markdown notes in bullet points using sentence fragments about {prompt} for a high school class. Include important terms, examples and explanations but be very concise. Put your result in a code block surrounded by "```"

Use double brackets notation inline to link to other notes, e.g. "Pedir is a [[Stem Changing Verb]]". At the top of the document include YAML frontmatter in the following format:
```
---
title: "Accuracy and Precision"
tags: ["science"]
banner_icon: ðŸŽ¯
---
```

Use a clever emoji in the `banner_icon` that matches the title, not the class. Be very concise with your notes. Only a few bullet points. Use four spaces for indents.
